## Mapty
Mapty is a web application designed for tracking and visualizing workouts. Whether you're into running or cycling, Mapty helps you log your activities, view them on a map, and keep a record of your progress over time.  

This project represents my first foray into utilizing API calls to enhance web applications, marking a significant milestone in my journey as a developer.
